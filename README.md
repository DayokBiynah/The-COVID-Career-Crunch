# 🦠 The COVID Career Crunch: A SQL-Driven Analysis of Job Market Disruption

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment using **SQL** for data analysis. I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of global layoffs to uncover trends, and industry-wide effects across different regions and time periods.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze job and layoff trends during and after the COVID-19 pandemic  
- Identify companies, industries, and regions most affected  
- Track labor market shifts and recovery across years  
- Derive key insights using only SQL queries and aggregations  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
| Tool    | Purpose                                        |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| **SQL** | Data cleaning, querying, aggregation, and EDA  |

## 📊 Key SQL Techniques Used
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window Functions (e.g., `DENSE_RANK()`, `OVER(ORDER BY ...)`)  
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` for summarizing patterns  
- `WHERE`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, and conditional filters for outliers  
- Date truncation for monthly and yearly analysis
